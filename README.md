### Corporate-Policy Sample Corpus (Phase 2)

Include 15 publicly available **HR, IT-security, supplier and ethics policies** drawn from technology, finance, retail, healthcare, energy, consulting and food-&-beverage firms.  
Because every organisationâ€”regardless of sectorâ€”must publish and enforce policies such as *Codes of Conduct* ðŸ”— [1], *Remote-Work rules* ðŸ”— [2] and *Supplier Codes of Conduct* ðŸ”— [3], a RAG chatbot trained on this diverse but common genre remains **sector-agnostic and reusable across clients**.  
The raw PDFs live in `/data/raw/`, are text-selectable, free for internal redistribution, and named `company_topic_YYYY.pdf` for traceability.

#### PhaseÂ 3 â€“ DocumentÂ â†’Â ChunkÂ â†’Â EmbeddingÂ pipeline

Run **`make ingest`** whenever you add or update PDFs in `/data/raw/`.  
The target calls `python ingest.py --pdf_dir data/raw`, which

1. crawls every PDF,
2. splits text intoÂ â‰ˆ500â€‘token chunks with 50â€‘token overlap,
3. generates dense *intfloat/e5â€‘large* embeddings, and
4. writes vectors + metadata into an embedded Qdrant collection.

The persisted vector store lives in `.storage/` (or `.qdrant/`)â€”both are gitâ€‘ignored and can be rebuilt deterministically at any time.
